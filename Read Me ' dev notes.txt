FOOD FOR ALL TASK FEATURE
This feature allows admins to:
Create tasks
Respond back and forth with volunteers on a profile-like page.
Update tasks.

It allows volunteers to:
View a list of tasks.
Correspond back and forth with the admin.


Technologies used:
PHP 7.3
MySQL 5.8 (PDO extension).

Programming style:
Since I had no idea what tools other developers would be using, and I wanted to avoid clashing with WordPress, I avoided Object Oriented programming. Thus this feature was built using procedural programming.
When I am more familiar with WordPress's own classes and functions, I will rewrite the code using OOP for better readerbility and maintanance.


I am waiting for Rob Edwards to okay a demo version before I commit the code. The demo can be viewed at:
ffatasks.epizy.com/tasks
The credential "jon snow" will log you in as an admin.
"elaida" will log you in as a volunteer.
